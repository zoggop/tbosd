title: Correct Parents
---

Psychologist parents are in fiction impotent parents. That they have such extensive professional knowledge over human nature leaves them uniquely blind to their children, or their normal parently blindness becomes uniquely ironic. Their often outlandish misunderstandings of their children are aggressive, even murderous, Oedipus in reverse. Amy's parents in *Gone Girl* are vampires, making a living off of who they somehow both believe and wish their daughter to be--"Amazing Amy".

Rachel's mother is a different kind of monster, one who believes (or wishes?) her daughter suffers from a nebulous mental illness that only she can diagnose and treat. Does a child under such egregious misrecognition judge herself by the nearly non-sequitor criteria of her mother? What kind of monster writes such an easily written off figure?

Someone like Quinn, I think, whose job is to set up the little universe of a reality show like dominos, so that the truths about human nature she believes people believe will reveal themselves again and again. Not, in theory, because she loves doing it, but because she knows "good television." To write fiction, like parenthood, is to bring something into the world, have it at your complete mercy, and yet hope that it gets away from you. The show's tension is that Quinn's show is successful because it and her prodigal prodigy and protege, Rachel, are always getting away from her. Rachel works from a different theory of the world--or theory of an audience's theory of the world-- less antiquated, less cruel, and uses it to tear holes in Quinn's show. But the holes are stunning products, vital patches to a worn fabric.

There's something cynical even about the show's cyninicsm. The show's show's contestants lie just below the intended audience's understanding of sexism and racism. One lets her racism show through a well-worn cliche, "I really do have lots of black friends." Such a phrase doesn't bear thinking; it's a box checked. Quinn's criteria for good TV read like a twitter feed of outrage: The writers of *UnREAL* believe in a producer who believes in an audience who believe sluts must be shamed, black women must be angry, and women with strong noses cannot get a man to marry. Upworthy is the other side of the same set of sociological truisms that every escape from is an occasion for wonder and hope.

Hence Rachel is the protagonist. Her half conscience moves her to deviate from the norm. (That's what we have left of an ethics: an imperative to not be normal.) Her self-destructive genius ways, in which her art is often veiled even from herself, act as a sieve between the show we're watching and the show she's helping to produce. Watching her bring about good TV is itself good TV, and when her conscience swings into place, she tries to bring the ethical world outside the show into the show.

The results of the latter cut both ways. In one episode, she almost ruins an episode of *Everlasting* by encouraging one of the contestants, Faith, to come out. On *UnREAL*, the ethical dilemma with this was a mismatch of contexts: Faith could not come out into the light of sexual self-understanding to her backwards Southern home. She'd get run out of town. The episode aired right after the Supreme Court ruling, otherwise known as the week all your friends' profile pictures got tinted rainbow. Rachel comes to Faith's home, quickly interprets the signs of sexuality, and becomes very sentimental about giving her the truth of her desires. It wasn't just exploitative to give the coming out footage to *Everlasting*--Rachel faught hard to prevent this from happening--Rachel herself fed off of it. It freed her from her self-loathing, briefly. At the height of her feeling for Faith, she gets teary. It's her rainbow selfie.

Before all this happens, of Faith, Quinn jeers "who knew horse-face was going to be a crowd favorite?" The writers of UnREAL, I guess?

Drama is necessarily manipulative, and one's highest hope for television is that it will be an excellent trap, but whenever I start to object to the specificity of *UnREAL*'s cynicism, I eventually realize I'm playing right into its hands. To watch the show is to become Rachel.
