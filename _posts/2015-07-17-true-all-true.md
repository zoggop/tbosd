title: True, All True

Maybe a year is not enough time to grow fonder, but the ominous helicopter pans over industrial cityscape (instead of flat Mississipi marsh) only had me going "ah, right, this." But I lie. In the first episode they inspect a murder victim's home. The camera lingers over his erotic wall art and sculptures like the helicopter does the smokestacks, like a hand-carved wooden cock (ha ha?) is as disturbing as it gets. Later, in the [requisite](http://uproxx.com/tv/2015/07/every-episode-of-true-detective/) car conversation scene, one of the detectives says "That shit in his house, I think he's into a lot of stuff we're just scratching."

And then the other dick gets shot in the dick with a shotgun. That seems just about the M.O. of the show regarding sex, a scattershot to the groin.

Reading about *True Detective* is like sorting through the princess's many mattresses. I have no idea why it's so much discussed and so reviled. I'm not even sure, where discussions of *True Detective* are concerned, that *True Detective* is ever discussed. The show is weirdly sublime, maybe in the gaseous sense. Those rebels who genuinely love it seem to have nothing to say about it. "Tightly executed noir," one called it. Is it satisfying to have one's expectations met? On the other hand it sounds awfully grandiose to consider every reading of fiction a little revolution, about which it would be a defeat to have precise predictions.

I know few things--a few things: I know that contrary to my expectations (or maybe, secretly, it wasn't?), I love to hate it, and that it seems incredibly boring to love to hate it, because who doesn't, because apparently one must differ. I know that Vince Vaughn looks like a Chihuahua, which is confusing, because I'm fond of Chihuahuas, and that, as a friend pointed out, the Chihuahua pictured below has an expression that one can find (only?) on *True Detective*.

I know that the show has a unique quality to its dialogue that I can neither describe nor fail to find ridiculous. I don't know anything further, but maybe the dialogue is like an overheard conversation I have an irrepressible urge to tweet or text, because otherwise I can't quite laugh, and instead spin like the proverbial self in the grave. It exerts some kind of quantum force on me. I know that many things make me giggle if know them, but I delude myself because actually I do not.
