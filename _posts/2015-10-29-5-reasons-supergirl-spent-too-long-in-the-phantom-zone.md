title: 5 Reasons "Supergirl" Spent Too Long in The Phantom Zone

1\. The feminist allegory begun with "I had no mission, Earth didn't need another hero" comes to nothing. Supergirl solves the same problems as Superman in a different city. ("That's the first thing Superman did, too: save a plane.") To the writers of "Supergirl", it would be sexist for her to do anything differently than the man. There are apparently no problems Superman couldn't solve if there were more than one of him.

2\. Cat's speech about the name "Supergirl" was considered interesting enough to include in the show *and* the trailer. No, it's not sexist to think Cat's vision of "excellence" is vapid ("I'm a girl and your boss and powerful and rich and hot and smart.")

2b\. Criminal waste of Calista Flockhart.

3\. A waitress at a diner says "can you believe it? A female hero. Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to." Did the audience roll their eyes a lot at the chorus in ancient Greece?

4\. "She's not strong enough." "Why? Because she's just a girl?" This is a first for me: the only instance I've seen in which calling it sexist is actually more sexist.

5\. An alien man tells Supergirl "on my planet, females bow before males." At first I was pleased that extreme misogyny has become the go-to shorthand for disposable bad guy. But my friend points out that the show has to look beyond Earth to find misogyny (and indeed patriarchy). I hope Kara's aunt succeeds in her (evil?) plan to rule Earth. This place is the worst.
